## Welcome

Welcome to the llm.rb deepdive. This document is a continuation of
the [homepage documentation](https://r.uby.dev/llm). It assumes you
are familiar with the basics already, and focuses on features that
didn't make it into the homepage documentation.

## MCP

#### stdio

The stdio transport connects to an MCP server that is launched as a
separate process, and both its standard input and standard output
streams are used for communication. It is recommended but not
required to execute commands for a stdio transport over a
persistent session via the
[`LLM::MCP#session`](https://r.uby.dev/api-docs/llm.rb/LLM/MCP.html#session-instance_method)
method &ndash; otherwise
you could end up launching the same process multiple times.

```ruby
require "llm"

llm   = LLM.deepseek(key: ENV["KEY"])
mcp   = LLM::MCP.stdio(argv: ["npx", "-y", "@forgejo/mcp-server"])
agent = LLM::Agent.new(llm)

mcp.session do
  agent.talk "What's happening on forgejo?", tools: mcp.tools
end
```

#### http

The http transport connects to an MCP server over HTTP, and unlike
the stdio transport, the MCP server does not have to be running
locally. Popular services like GitHub provide their own MCP server
over HTTP, and it is one of the most capable MCP servers I have
used.

Unlike the stdio transport,
[`LLM::MCP#session`](https://r.uby.dev/api-docs/llm.rb/LLM/MCP.html#session-instance_method)
carries little benefit for the http transport and it can be
omitted.  It is recommended to consider the `net_http_persistent`
transport for MCP interactions that run over HTTP, otherwise
you could end up tearing down and setting up the same connection
multiple times.

```ruby
require "llm"

llm   = LLM.deepseek(key: ENV["KEY"])
mcp   = LLM::MCP.http(
  url: "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
  headers: {
    "Authorization" => "Bearer #{ENV.fetch('GITHUB_PAT')}"
  },
  transport: :net_http_persistent
)
agent = LLM::Agent.new(llm)
agent.talk "What's happening on GitHub?", tools: mcp.tools
```
## A2A

#### rest

The rest transport communicates with other agents via A2A
endpoints that speak both HTTP and JSON. The skills advertised
by an agent become subclasses of
[`LLM::Tool`](https://r.uby.dev/api-docs/llm.rb/LLM/Tool.html)
that can be used by both
[`LLM::Context`](https://r.uby.dev/api-docs/llm.rb/LLM/Context.html),
and [`LLM::Agent`](https://r.uby.dev/api-docs/llm.rb/LLM/Agent.html)
&ndash; similar to how MCP tools become subclasses of
[`LLM::Tool`](https://r.uby.dev/api-docs/llm.rb/LLM/Tool.html).

```ruby
require "llm"

llm   = LLM.deepseek(key: ENV["KEY"])
a2a   = LLM::A2A.rest(url: "https://agent.example.com")
agent = LLM::Agent.new(llm, tools: a2a.skills)
agent.talk "What's happening, fellow agent?"
```

#### jsonrpc

The jsonrpc transport communicates with other agents via HTTP
and a protocol known as jsonrpc. Sometimes an agent will
implement both, or just one of each. An agent's card, which
is represented by an instance of
[`LLM::A2A::Card`](https://r.uby.dev/api-docs/llm.rb/LLM/A2A/Card.html),
can be
used to discover available transports via the
[`LLM::A2A::Card#interfaces`](https://r.uby.dev/api-docs/llm.rb/LLM/A2A/Card.html#interfaces-instance_method)
method.

```ruby
require "llm"
llm   = LLM.deepseek(key: ENV["KEY"])
a2a   = LLM::A2A.jsonrpc(url: "https://agent.example.com")
agent = LLM::Agent.new(llm, tools: a2a.skills)
agent.talk "What's happening, fellow agent?"
```
