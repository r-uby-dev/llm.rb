  spec.description = <<~DESC
  llm.rb is Ruby's capable AI runtime.

  It runs on Ruby's standard library by default. loads optional pieces
  only when needed, and offers a single runtime for providers, agents,
  tools, skills, MCP, A2A (Agent2Agent), RAG (vector stores & embeddings),
  streaming, files, and persisted state. As a bonus, llm.rb is also available
  for mruby.

  It supports OpenAI, OpenAI-compatible endpoints, Anthropic, Google
  Gemini, DeepSeek, xAI, Z.ai, AWS Bedrock, Ollama, and llama.cpp. It
  also includes built-in ActiveRecord and Sequel support, plus concurrent
  tool execution through threads, tasks (via async gem), fibers, ractors,
  and fork (via xchan.rb gem).
